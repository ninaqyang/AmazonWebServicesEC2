# AmazonWebServicesEC2
Made a login check (with username and password field), then set up a local tomcat server that served up the jsp files. 
Deployed files onto Amazon EC2, and tested it to ensure the login worked. Added this login to an existing game created with UIKitDynamics. 
Made a request to the jsp to see if login to the game was successful or not, and if the correct username/password were entered the game opens.
